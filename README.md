# Python 3 Workshop

## What's In this Repository
* **files** contains 3 data files you will use during the workshop
* **workshop_scripts** contains the Python scripts for this workshop. These are what you will be running. 
* **workshop_notebooks** contains the same Python scripts as **workshop_scripts**, but they are formatted in a better way for notebook-style IDEs such as Jupyter Notebook. 
* **README.md** is the file that creates this description
* **Workshop_Slides.pdf** contains a PDF of the workshop slides

## What You Need:
* Python 3 on your computer. [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is one site offering Python 3 downloads. 
* An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which supports Python 3. Not sure what to do? Try downloading the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for Python 3.7, then use Spyder or Jupyter Notebook.
* The packages listed below 
* These files on your computer. Download them using the green "Clone or Download" button above and selecting "Download ZIP." You will need to unzip the download before you can open the files on your computer.  

## Packages
You will need each of the following Python packages:
* Numpy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Astropy

To download each of the packages, go to the **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac) app. Then, type ```pip install package_name``` (where the package name is all lowercase) and press ```enter```. 

For example, to download NumPy, use ```pip install numpy```.

Having trouble? Check out this [pip tutorial](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/python-pip-usage/). If you are using the Anaconda Distribution, you should also be aware of the ```conda``` installer, which acts a lot like ```pip```. [Here](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/understanding-conda-and-pip#:~:text=This%20highlights%20a%20key%20difference,downloading%20and%20running%20an%20installer.) is a good description of ```pip``` and ```conda```.
