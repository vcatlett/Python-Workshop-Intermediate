# UTD REU Python 3 Workshop

## What's In this Repository
* **files** contains 3 data files you will use during the workshop
* **workshop_scripts** contains the Python scripts for this workshop. These are what you will be running. 
* **workshop_notebooks** contains the same Python scripts as **workshop_scripts**, but they are formatted in a better way for notebook-style IDEs such as Jupyter Notebook. 
* **README.md** is the file that creates this description

## What You Need:
* Python 3 on your computer. [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is one site offering Python 3 downloads. 
* An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which supports Python 3
Not sure what to do? Try downloading the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for Python 3.7, then use Spyder or Jupyter Notebook. 

## Packages
You will need each of the following Python packages:
* Numpy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Astropy

To download each of the package, go to the Command Line (Windows) or Terminal (Mac). Then, type ```pip install package_name``` (where the package name is all lowercase) and press ```enter```. If you are using the Anaconda Distribution, you can also use ```conda install package_name```.

For example, to download NumPy, use ```pip install numpy```.
